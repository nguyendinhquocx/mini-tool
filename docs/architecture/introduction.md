# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for File Rename Tool, including frontend UI architecture, backend file processing systems, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach adapts traditional fullstack concepts to desktop application context, treating UI layer and file processing engine as integrated but distinct architectural concerns.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status**: Brownfield project with existing Python codebase (`file.py`)

**Existing Implementation Analysis**:
- Complete Tkinter GUI với 4-tab interface (File rename, Excel mapping, Info export, Folder operations)
- Vietnamese text normalization logic với proven algorithms
- Excel/CSV file operations cho advanced mapping scenarios
- Error handling và debug logging infrastructure
- Cross-platform file operations với Windows focus

**Architecture Constraints**:
- Must leverage existing Python business logic
- Preserve proven file operation patterns
- Enhance packaging và distribution approach
- Improve error resilience và user experience
- Maintain backward compatibility với existing workflows
