# File Rename Tool Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Giảm 80% time spent on file renaming tasks (từ 2-3 phút xuống 30 giây)
- Tạo standalone desktop app loại bỏ dependency hell và context switching cost
- Cung cấp Vietnamese-optimized text normalization không có ở existing tools
- Thiết lập foundation cho future mini-tool suite expansion
- Đạt daily active usage trong 2 tuần đầu sau install với 90%+ user satisfaction

### Background Context
File Rename Tool giải quyết productivity bottleneck nghiêm trọng trong workflow hàng ngày của knowledge workers. Hiện tại, việc đổi tên file hàng loạt với Vietnamese normalization rules đòi hỏi mở development environment và chạy Python script, tạo ra 2-3 phút friction cho task 30 giây. Tool sẽ transform existing proven Python codebase thành standalone Windows executable, loại bỏ barriers và integrate seamlessly vào daily workflow.

5. **NFR5**: Application must run without requiring Python installation hoặc additional dependencies
6. **NFR6**: UI must be responsive and provide feedback during long-running operations
7. **NFR7**: Application must handle Windows file system permissions gracefully

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Clean, utilitarian desktop application focused on efficiency và safety. Interface prioritizes preview-first workflow để prevent accidental bulk renames. Design language should be consistent với Windows 10/11 native applications using standard controls và conventions.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Browse-Preview-Execute workflow**: User selects folder → previews changes → confirms execution
- **Drag-and-drop support**: Direct folder dropping vào application window
- **Progress indication**: Real-time feedback during batch operations với ability to cancel
- **Error-first design**: Potential issues highlighted before execution, clear error states

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Application Window**: Central hub với folder selection, file list, và action buttons
- **Preview Mode**: Split view showing before/after file names với highlighting of changes
- **Progress Dialog**: Modal progress indicator với cancel functionality và operation details
- **Settings Panel**: Configuration for normalization rules và application preferences (future)

### Accessibility: None (MVP focus)

### Branding
Minimal branding approach focusing on functionality over aesthetics. Use Windows 10/11 Fluent Design principles với subtle accent colors. No elaborate branding requirements for personal utility tool.

### Target Device and Platforms: Desktop Only
Windows 10/11 desktop application optimized cho keyboard và mouse interaction. No mobile hoặc web responsive requirements.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all components: UI code, business logic, build scripts, và documentation. Simple structure appropriate for single-developer utility application.

### Service Architecture
Monolithic desktop application với modular internal structure. Clear separation between UI layer (Tkinter), business logic (file operations), và data layer (settings/logging). No external services hoặc network dependencies required.

### Testing Requirements
Unit testing for core file operation logic và Vietnamese normalization functions. Manual testing for UI workflows và edge cases. Integration testing for full rename workflows với various file types và edge cases.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Packaging**: Use PyInstaller để create standalone executable từ Python codebase
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging to local files cho debugging và support
- **Configuration**: INI hoặc JSON file cho user preferences và application settings
- **Backward Compatibility**: Support Windows 10 và newer, focus on 64-bit systems
- **Code Reuse**: Leverage existing Python file operation logic với minimal modifications
